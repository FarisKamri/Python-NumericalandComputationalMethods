# Numerical and Computational Methods
This Jupyter Notebook is a summary of the skills I have developed while studying the Numerical and Computational Methods module, using **Python 3**.
The module is mainly focussing on the algorithms that can be used to solve mathematical problems and how to program them on a computer. <hr>

Libraries used in this notebook: **NumPy, Matplotlib, mpmath, PyLab, SciPy.**
